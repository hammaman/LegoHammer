Purpose of the program
----------------------

The car needs to follow the black line on a white background.

Program logic:

Car starts with middle sensor on black line (check LED is not lit) 

'''
Main loop:
Move forwards
Keep track of last time that each sensor last detected black
Check sensors:
If middle sensor is detecting black, loop round to start of main loop
If middle sensor is detecting white, then:
  stop
  determine which direction to turn:
     if any sensors detecting black, turn in this direction
     if no sensors detecting black, determine which sensor last detected black and turn in this direction
     secondary loop:
       moving in that direction until middle sensor detects black, then quit this secondary loop
Loop round
