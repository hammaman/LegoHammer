Three point turn
----------------

Initially planned to use a magnetometer, but not able to get this working reliably
Instead using a timed approach

Program logic:
```
Move forwards for 150cm
Turn left 90 degrees
Move forwards for 70cm
Turn left 180 degrees
Move forwards for 140cm
Turn left 180 degrees
Move forwards for 70cm
Turn left 90 degrees
Move forwards for 150cm (back to start)

Key variable is:
TIME_TO_COVER_1M = time to cover 1m in milliseconds
```
