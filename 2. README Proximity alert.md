Proximity alert challenge
-------------------------

Need robot to approach a wall and detect distance using ultrasonic sensor
Lego car using lowest gear ratio


Program logic:

Move forward
Main loop:
   Calculate distance to wall, keep track of last 2 distances
   Determine a rolling average (of say three loops), to avoid the odd random fluctuation in readings
   Stop if within specified distance to wall (determined by distance from sensor to front of car, and margin for error)
   
Key variables which need to be set:
DIST_SENSOR_TO_FRONT: distance from sensor to front of car
DIST_MARGIN_FOR_ERROR: margin for error
